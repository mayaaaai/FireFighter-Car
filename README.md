# FireFighter-Car

THE IDEA:

We thought it would be a really funny to create project that might also work as a real thing if we adjust and improve the mechanics sometime in the future. So we conceived the model of a simple fire alarm, using flame sensors and the analogic values they are generating to discover the precise location of the fire. We added to that simple fire alarm system an extinguish mechanism that helps us put down the fire based on the analogic values of the sensors.


PURPOSE:

In the simplest terms, the role of a fire alarm system is to detect fire and alert people around the problematic area. As a bonus, our fire alarm system comes with an extinguish system that puts down the fire using the water from the tank and also the water pump to reach that specific area.
